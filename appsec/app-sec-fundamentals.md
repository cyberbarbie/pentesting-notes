# Notes on AppSec
#### Notes from Bob & Alice Learn Application Security 
![SDLC diagram](/appsec/SDLC-Process.png)
No. 1 reason for data breaches are insecure software 
Never make assumptions and verify every fact 

Network perimeters - firewall
Enterprise security - blocking malware and not allowing admin rights for most users 
Physical - badges in and out of secured areas 

### Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - 
	- Requirements - Define what you are building (is it a product, a feature?)
	- Design - Create a plan
	- Coding - Build it 
	- Testing - Verify it does all that's intended 
	- Release - deploy 
	- Maintenance - Monitoring, updates

**Shift left** - Treat security from the start as an integral part of the SDLC;

**CIA Triad** - The 3 main points that all organizations strive to achieve
Confidentiality
Integrity 
Availability 

**Assume Breach**
Prepare for the worst in order to minimize risk, detection time, and remediation; done by monitoring and logging systems; ex opening an online document-sharing account (don't upload anything sensitive/of value, set up account monitoring and have a plan if docs are removed, stolen, shared publicly 

Good example of "Assume Breach" in enterprise - Never use an online file-sharing service to share documents; design network, systems, processes, and applications assuming breach; hunt for threats on their network, design zero-trust network, monitor the internet for signs of data leakage, authenticate to APIs before connecting, verify data from the db and from internal APIs, perform red teaming exercises (security testing in prod) and monitor network and apps closely for anomalies; write automated response to common attack patterns; analyze behavioral patterns for signs of breach

Coordinated disclosure - Not disclosing a vulnerability for a specified period of time until it's been patched  

Web proxy software - Like Burp suite for instance (DAST) are usually forbidden on enterprise networks; aka web app scanners; never point one at a web app and perform active scanning w/o written permission

Defense in Depth - The concept of having multiple layers of security
Examples of Defense in Depth in Practice:
	- Processes - Checking badges/IDs before delivering mail; having to pass security testing before software can be released 
	- Physical/Software/Hardware systems - Door locks, network firewall, hardware encryption 
	- Built-in design functions
	- Writing separate functions for code that handles more sensitive tasks in an app
	
**Examples of Defense in Depth for an application**
	- **Secure Software** - Define security requirements, perform threat modeling, use secure design and coding concepts, security testing 
	- **Network security** - Monitoring, SIEM, have IPS and IDS (Networking Systems to detect and respond to threats depending on the system), firewall
	- **Physical security** - locks, surveillance, motion sensors 
	- **Web App Firewall**
	- **How to advocate for additional layers of defense** - Communicate value (monetary, reputation, national security) and risk 

**Threat modeling** - identifying threats to application and create plans for mitigation

**Least privilege** - The concept of issuing the least amount of access and privilege based on role (admin, guest, user)

**Examples of least privilege** 
	- Requiring extra security approvals to have access to a lab/area 
	- No admin/root privilege on desktop at work (this builds on the "assume breach" principle imo because you're doing this to minimize risk and planning ahead in an effort to reduce how much access an adversary would obtain if they hacked your computer)
